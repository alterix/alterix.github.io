   </div>
   
   <div id="intro-statement">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Hi Lani, this page should pretty much cover everything you need to know about installing the mod. I had to
      downgrade from 0.15.1 to 0.14.1 because the former doesn't support the mod, which was created for the latter.</p>
      <p>I'm not experienced in using the Android, so this guide isn't 100% accurate, be sure to text me when something
      unexpected happens.</p>
      <p>Let's not keep you waiting any longer, let's begin.</p>
    </div>
 
    <div id="guide-0">
      <h3>Installing Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.14.1</h3>
      <p>The apk file is really hard to find in the internet through Google, so I'm going to provide you a torrent 
      link here:</p>

      </table>
      
      <p>Both of the provided pages require μTorrent to download the file, so you're going to need to download
      <a href="http://bit.ly/105hCM6">here</a> it if you haven't already. (Link points you to Google Play/App Store,
      you haven't already.</p>

      <h3>Installing BlockLauncher Pro</h3>
      <p>You'll need the BlockLauncher Pro app to <i>import</i> the Comes Alive mod. You're going to run that instead of
      the Minecraft PE App to use the mod.</p>

      <h3>Installing the Comes Alive Mod</h3>
      <p>The mod pretty much has what you wanted, but not right now because the mod is still work in progress, I'll
      update you when the mod is finally finished. It's supposed to have villagers you can interact, be in a relationship
      with, have a family with, and so on. (If you wanted a child, you're going to have to use spawn eggs via creative
      mode. The sex feature isn't available yet :p.</p>
      
      <p>The version we use is 0.14.1 and the mod is for 0.14.0, but there's nothing to worry, as long as the mod is not
        newer than the version we have, everything's fine.</p>

      <h3>Installation Steps</h3>
      <p>Now that you have downloaded what you need, let's begin!</p>
      <ol start=-1>
        <li>I don't think I have to tell you this, but just in case, Install Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.14.1,
        the BlockLauncher Pro, and the Mod.</li>
        <li>Open BlockLauncher. It might crash a lot... but don't give up.</li>
        <li>There should be a wrench icon on top. Click it.</li>
        <li>Select "Manage ModPE Scripts".</li>
        <li>Click on the "+" sign on the bottom right.</li>
        <li>Select "local storage".</li>
        <li>Find where "913_comes-alive-pe-.modpkg" and select that.</li>
        <li>Create a survival world, the seed must have a village in it. (-1385905961, Triple Village Seed at Spawn)</li>
        <li>There should be a crystal ball in the inventory, throw it.</li>
        <li>Follow instructions provided</li>
        <li>Head for the nearest village you see (Probably behind the swampland).</li>
        <li>If you see a villager, you should notice tht their appearance changed, being near to them shows the "Interact"
        button. For now, the only thing you can do is get them to follow you.</li>
   
      </ol>

      <h3>Final Statement</h3>
      <p>Have fun!~ ^_^, if there's a problem you've come across, talk to me about it. But, assuming that you read this
      on Friday, I'll be on the Google I/O seminar, so it might take long before I reply you, but I'll do it ASAP.
      I'm free on 5:30 PM, I'm probably in a jeepney at that time.</p>

    <p>Did you perhaps wanted the 0.15.1.12 instead? Here's the <a href="files/mcpe01512.apk">Direct Download</a>.</p>
